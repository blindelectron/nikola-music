# nikola-music
A small plugin for genorating music track pages with nikola.
Note that this plugin was for my use, so it is pritty ugly.
## setup
1: copy templates folder in to your nikola sight.
2: coppy the music.py and music.plugin files in to your nikola sight/plugins/music.
3: create some wave, mp3, or flac files in your nikola site/files/music
4: run ```nikola build```.
That's it, with luck, you should now have a music folder in your output directory containing your music files, and there corresponding html files.
